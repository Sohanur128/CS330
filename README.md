# CS 330 Module Eight Journal
# How do I approach designing software?
I think about what the user needs. I think about how to keep the design simple. I break the design into smaller parts. I focus on one part at a time. I use clear goals for each part.

# What new design skills has my work on the project helped me to craft?
I learned to use shapes to build objects. I learned to plan camera movement. I learned to design lighting for scenes. I learned to use textures to improve design.

# What design process did I follow for my project work?
I chose simple shapes first. I placed them in the scene. I added textures. I added lighting. I tested camera movement. I checked if everything worked. I made changes when needed.

# How could tactics from my design approach be applied in future work?
I will use simple planning first. I will break projects into parts. I will test after each part. I will use shapes and textures to create objects. I will check the user view.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I write clear and small functions. I test my code after each part. I keep the code readable. I use comments to explain my code. I use tools to debug and test.

# What new development strategies did I use while working on my 3D scene?
I used managers to organize code. I used functions to handle textures and lighting. I used input keys to control camera movement. I used modular design to keep code clean.

# How did iteration factor into my development?
I test the scene after each step. I make changes when something does not work. I add objects one at a time. I test textures and lighting. I improve the scene with each change.

# How has my approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led me to the projectâ€™s completion?
I started with small shapes. I learned to add textures. I learned to add lighting. I added camera movement. I learned to organize code in managers. I learned to test and fix issues early.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I want to build software in the future. Computer science helps me learn how to solve problems. It helps me learn to write clear code. It helps me learn to test and improve code.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future educational pathway?
I learned how to use OpenGL. I learned how to build 3D objects. I learned how to use textures and lighting. I learned how to test scenes. I can use these skills in other graphics courses.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future professional pathway?
I learned how to build 3D scenes for simulations. I learnrf how to add user controls to scenes. I also learned how to design visual models for users. I can use these skills in game design. I can use these skills in software projects with 3D elements.
